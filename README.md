# Matrix-Mixer
A touch based matrix mixer instrument I have designed.
I will be uploading eagle files/gerbers for different versions of the project.
I have made the size 100X70 this means components will have to be attached via jumper cables. This is because the footprint of 
the circuit would be very large otherwise for a relatively simple circuit.The pontentiometers labelled sp are Soft Pots made
by SpectraSymbol. 

There are a few things one can edit to make the design more simple like removing the softpots and switches and/or removing 1/4 inch jack sockets at top and bottom.I am also using Push/Pull pots but this design will work with a regular pot and a 6 pin DPDT switch.

This will leave you with a circuit diagram much the same as one described in Nicolas Collins Handmade Electronics The Art of 
Hacking.

Enjoy.
