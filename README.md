# Matrix-Mixer
A touch based matrix mixer instrument I have designed.
I will be uploading eagle files/gerbers for different versions of the project.
I have made the size 100X70 this means components will have to be attached via jumper cables. This is because the footprint of 
the circuit would be very large otherwise for a relatively simple circuit.The pontentiometers labelled sp are Soft Pots made
by SpectraSymbol 

There are a few things one can edit to make the design more simple like 
-removing the softpots and switches 
-removing 1/4 inch jack sockets at top and bot 

this will leave you with a circuit diagram much the same as one described in Nicolas Collin Handmade Electronics The Art of 
Hacking.
